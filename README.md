# Adapter Design Pattern Example
Sample code largely taken from [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/adapter_pattern.htm).

## Notes
-----
- **Loose coupling** is essentially when components are weakly associated with each other, so the existence (or lack thereof) of a component doesn't affect any other component. 
- A lot of visuals were taken from [Refactoring Guru's article](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter) on this design pattern. The outlet visuals were taken from [World Power Plugs](https://world-power-plugs.com/canada-to-singapore).
- I've used a lot of sources to help with learning about this, which I will list.
